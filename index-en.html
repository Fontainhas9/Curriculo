                            <li>At the Centro de Computação Gráfica, I served as a Programmer and Application Developer, contributing to an intelligent traffic-management and control system aimed at enhancing connectivity between vehicles and pedestrians. My primary role involved implementing advanced collision-detection and avoidance algorithms in Python that run in real time, synchronizing with (1) pedestrians via a smartphone application that issues proactive warnings whenever the user enters a collision-risk trajectory, and (2) vehicles via an On-Board Unit (OBU) that delivers in-vehicle alerts of the same potential hazard. Communication between the OBU and the pedestrian’s mobile application is coordinated by a Road-Side Unit (RSU), which brokers device interoperability and relays position- and velocity-sensor data with low latency to support predictive calculations.</li> 
                            <li>As a data analyst, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that support strategic business decision-making. I am highly proficient with analytical and visualization tools such as Power BI and Power Query, as well as programming in Python, with extensive use of libraries like Pandas for efficient data manipulation and Matplotlib for analytical visualizations. I have substantial experience in cleaning, transforming, and modeling large datasets, ensuring data integrity and consistency for in-depth exploratory analysis. Furthermore, I design interactive dashboards and dynamic reports that enhance cross-functional communication and contribute directly to data-driven strategy development.</li> 
                            <li>I am currently developing an embedded system using the Arduino IDE to program a C++-based microcontroller board capable of detecting discrete input events via physical buttons and establishing communication with Access Points over Wi-Fi. The primary goal of this project is to achieve seamless integration of hardware and software components to enable real-time functionalities tailored to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Furthermore, the platform incorporates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning capabilities to detect and identify nearby devices for the purpose of indoor localization within industrial environments, such as factory floors, thereby supporting advanced positioning systems.</li>
