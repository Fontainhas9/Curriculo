                            <li>At the Centro de Computação Gráfica, I served as a Programmer and Application Developer, contributing to an intelligent traffic-management and control system aimed at enhancing connectivity between vehicles and pedestrians. My primary role involved implementing advanced collision-detection and avoidance algorithms in Python that run in real time, synchronizing with (1) pedestrians via a smartphone application that issues proactive warnings whenever the user enters a collision-risk trajectory, and (2) vehicles via an On-Board Unit (OBU) that delivers in-vehicle alerts of the same potential hazard. Communication between the OBU and the pedestrian’s mobile application is coordinated by a Road-Side Unit (RSU), which brokers device interoperability and relays position- and velocity-sensor data with low latency to support predictive calculations.</li> 
                            <li>As a data analyst, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that support strategic business decision-making. I am highly proficient with analytical and visualization tools such as Power BI and Power Query, as well as programming in Python, with extensive use of libraries like Pandas for efficient data manipulation and Matplotlib for analytical visualizations. I have substantial experience in cleaning, transforming, and modeling large datasets, ensuring data integrity and consistency for in-depth exploratory analysis. Furthermore, I design interactive dashboards and dynamic reports that enhance cross-functional communication and contribute directly to data-driven strategy development.</li> 
                            <li>I am currently developing an embedded system for indoor localization in industrial environments, using ESP32 microcontrollers programmed in C++. The system detects devices through multi-round Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning, collecting multiple RSSI samples to improve positioning accuracy. Communication with the infrastructure is ensured via Wi-Fi using REST/HTTP APIs for transmitting telemetry data to a central server. The platform includes remote management features, with an embedded web interface that allows reconfiguration of network parameters without physical intervention, and integrates with a Blynk dashboard for real-time monitoring of device and sensor network status. The architecture is designed for robustness in industrial environments, implementing time synchronization (NTP), automatic connection recovery, and application state control mechanisms.</li>

                        <p class="job-location">In partnership with Hydra IT</p>

                                As part of the Master's dissertation in Information Systems Engineering and Management, I developed a module in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with the goal of calculating the carbon footprint associated with products. 
                                The work arose from the growing need for companies to evaluate and report the environmental impact of their operations, in line with international best sustainability practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was supported by recognized methodologies, such as the GHG Protocol and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which ensured consistency and scientific rigor in the calculations. 
                                Based on these foundations, I defined the functional and technical requirements necessary for the system to be modular, generic, and adaptable to different industrial contexts, minimizing changes whenever it was applied in new organizations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The implementation was carried out in AL language, leveraging tables, pages, and ERP flows to create an integrated and practical solution. 
                                The developed functionalities include the calculation of direct and indirect emissions associated with the production process, as well as the possibility of obtaining estimates of expected emissions and actual values based on the data effectively recorded in the system. 
                                To validate the solution, practical examples of products and production lines were used, allowing the applicability of the module in real-world scenarios to be proven.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, I prepared detailed documentation and a user manual intended for end-users, ensuring a faster and more efficient adoption of the tool. 
                                Beyond the technical development, this work contributed to reinforcing business awareness of sustainability and environmental impact, showing how it is possible to combine management technology with environmental responsibility practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The dissertation was presented in 2022 as part of the Master's in Information Systems Engineering and Management at the University of Minho, consolidating technical skills in software development, information systems integration, and the application of environmental methodologies in a business context.
